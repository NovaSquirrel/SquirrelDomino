# SquirrelDomino
 
This is a clone of a well-known puzzle game, but with modern features like ghost pieces and hard drops, and it's generally a lot faster feeling than the original game. There are multiple backgrounds and color schemes available, and there are several optional gimmicks you can play with.

The code is available under the zlib license, but please don't reuse the background graphics for other projects.
